# my-blog-notes

Taking notes for various topics as I learn and grow.

Ideally, all of them will be published to my [personal blog](https://guihao-liang.github.io/).

In order to view posts as pure markdown format by IDE or Jekyll generated html through the http server, all images in blog posts aren't stored locally becuase image search paths of markdown and Jekyll are different. All images are loaded through `https` links to serve my personal site as a fully secure stie.

Image sources with non-`https` will be downloaed, and stored into google drive folder [guihao-liang.io](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17u5nF94bN5-W7ngdKjy8DU_RfEZTQDDj). And corresponding secure `https` link will be provided through Google drive. The reason to do this is due to the fact that I cannot afford a private image hosting service.
