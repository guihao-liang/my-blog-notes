## brk or break

I read one great article for [introducing JIT](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2013/11/05/how-to-jit-an-introduction). There's a section where it mentions __heap__ memory can be requested by system call `brk` and `sbrk`. But what do they stands for?

From the [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/2/sbrk),

> brk() and sbrk() change the location of the program break, which defines the end of the process's data segment (i.e., the program break is the first location after the end of the uninitialized data segment. Increasing the program break has the effect of allocating memory to the process; decreasing the break deallocates memory.

* `brk` is short for program __break__ address, whose initial and lowest value is first address after the end of __BSS__.

* `sbrk` stands for __space__ increments after program __break__ address, which means to incrementally add new memory to the heap region, as it is shown [below][data-segment]. This system call is actually used by `malloc` and `free`.

## digression to BSS

[BSS][bss-segment] stands for __Block Started by Symbol__, which means in binary (object) file, there's no actual data in this section. This section stores the symbols that are __uninitialized__ in text code and meta data needed to initialize the data at runtime.

> In C, statically-allocated objects without an explicit initializer are initialized to zero (for arithmetic types) or a null pointer (for pointer types). Implementations of C typically represent zero values and null pointer values using a bit pattern consisting solely of zero-valued bits (though this is not required by the C standard).

Unlike the [data segment][data-segment], actual value (data) is stored. BSS section only stores symbol and its size because its value will be zero initialized. For example, if you have a `int a[1000]`, you can store its symbol and size (4 bytes) as meta data, instead of `4000` bytes into its binary (object) file. That's why people sometimes call it __Better Save Space__. When the object file is loaded at runtime, and right before program starts, BSS will be initialized with 4000 bytes of memory, with all bytes set to zero.

> the BSS segment typically includes all uninitialized objects (both variables and constants) declared at file scope (i.e., outside any function) as well as uninitialized static local variables (local variables declared with the static keyword)

Let's examine it with global variable,

```cpp
cat <<EOF > gui.cc
int global; /* Uninitialized variable stored in bss*/
int main(void) { return 0; }
EOF
```

compile it and check:

```bash
$ clang++ gui.cc
$ size
text  data   bss   dec   hex  filename
87    0      4     91    5b   a.out
```

The `bss` size is 4, which is size for `int` type in my machine. Let's initialize the global variable with some value explicitly,

```cpp
cat <<EOF > gui.cc
int global = 53; /* initialized data in data segment */
int main(void) { return 0; }
EOF
```

compile it and check the size required by each section,

```shell
$ clang++ gui.cc
$ size
text  data   bss   dec   hex  filename
87    4      0     91    5b   a.out
```

As you can see, `bss` size is 0 and `data` is 4 now.
