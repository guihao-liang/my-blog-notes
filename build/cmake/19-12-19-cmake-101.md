I really recommend reading the book [mastering CMake](0). It covers many key and fundamental concepts about CMake. Personally, I like to learn things systematically. First few chapters of this book explains CMake's internal working mechanisom and its basic language syntax extremely well and clear. For practitioners, I recommend to get hands dirty by following [examples](1) after getting exposed to some fundementals of CMake.

## if-else

## macros

## functions

## scopes

## some great resources
