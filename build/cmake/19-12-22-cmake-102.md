## big picture

Below is a picture referenced from that post, which depicts the CMake workflow: configuration and generation.
![cmake workflow](https://preshing.com/images/cmake-simple-flowchart.png)

The first step of CMake is configuration, where it executes the `CMakeLists.txt` and figure out **targets** defined in `CMakeLists.txt`.

If the first step goes without an error, it proceeds to the second step, where **targets** will be used by the `generator` to generate build pipelines, which are **input files** for different build system, such as Unix Makefiles, and XCodeproject files, etc.

---

## key concepts

- source file: lowest level, corresponding C/C++ source files; source files are **combined** into targets.
- target: typically executable or library (add_library, add_executable, add_custom_target).
- directory: represent a dir in source tree, and typically has a CMakeLists.txt and one or more targets
- generator: every dir has a local generator that is responsible for generating the Makefiles or project files for that dir. All of the local generators share a common global generator that oversees the build process.

## project

### target_compile_definitions

> The INTERFACE, PUBLIC and PRIVATE keywords are required to specify the scope of the following arguments. **PRIVATE** and **PUBLIC** items will populate the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property of <target>. **PUBLIC** and **INTERFACE** items will populate the INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property of <target>. (IMPORTED targets only support INTERFACE items.) The following arguments specify compile definitions. Repeated calls for the same <target> append items in the order called.

Any leading -D on an item will be removed. Empty items are ignored. For example, the following are all equivalent:

```cmake
target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC FOO)
target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC -DFOO)  # -D removed
target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC "" FOO) # "" ignored
target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC -D FOO) # -D becomes "", then ignored
```

what is PUBLIC, INTERFACE, PRIVATE ???

### [override the compile flags for single file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13638408/override-compile-flags-for-single-files)

In my turicreate project, I made one mistake,

```CM ake
set_source_files_properties(lambda_omp.hpp PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS -fopenmp)
```

I thought when it compiles in the build pipeline, it will include the actual header file in the build command and the flags associated to header file will be picked up.

```bash
make -fopenmp lambda_omp.hpp other_source_include_lambda_omp_hpp.cpp -o ...
```

This quite usual when we use `make` to build a small project what we pass all headers and source files. And headers are part of the entire sources.

But the reality is that `-fopenmp` is never used by the underlying build system. What happens?

Let's first talk about how we can [include headers to targets with CMake](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13703647/how-to-properly-add-include-directories-with-cmake). We must specify the directory to find header files we need and add both headers and implementation files as dependcencies to the target:

```CMake
set(SOURCES file.cpp file2.cpp ${INCLUDE_DIR}/file1.h ${INCLUDE_DIR}/file2.h)
add_executable(target ${SOURCES})
```

Headers can be dependcencies for a target but `HEADER FILES ARE NOT COMPILED`, and the source files that include the header files are compiled. That's why the `COMPILE_FLAGS` I set for the header file is not used.

Let's also look at the documentation for `set_source_files_properties`:
> These flags will be added to the list of compile flags when this source file builds.
I guess `header file` is never used for build purposes.

If you want to know more modifying compile flags for source files, check this [awesome anwser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13638408/override-compile-flags-for-single-files).

## cache

```cmake
/Users/guihaoliang/Work/guicreate-2/src/external/openmp/openmp-src/runtime/src/z_Linux_asm.S:1752:5: error: unknown directive
    .size __kmp_unnamed_critical_addr,8
    ^
```

Add -integrated-as or -no-integrated-as to CFLAGS -- maybe that would fix it.  Use the check_and_set_compiler_flag in the base CMakeLists.txt

check_and_set_compiler_flag("-integrated-as")

CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS directly.

## only for preprocessor

compile flag vs preprocessor flag

add_definitions(-DCFLAGS="-fPIC ${C_REAL_COMPILER_FLAGS}")
add_definitions(-DCPPFLAGS="-fPIC ${CPP_REAL_COMPILER_FLAGS}")

running cmake -D... defines a variable in cmake.  So does set(...).  add_definitions defines something in the preprocessor.

compiler flags are controlled by the cmake variables present when the source file is defined.  These variables are CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS and CMAKE_<LANG>_<MODE>_FLAGS.
LANG is either C or CXX
MODE is either DEBUG or RELEASE


targets are simply nodes in the compilation or linking graph that CMake builds to use for both compiling and linking.  They can be both.  A library that depends on a target depends on it both for compilation and linking.  target_include_directories modifies the include_directory property of all dependent targets, so that target's sources have an additional include directory.


## force copy to override cache

set(LIBOMP_COPY_EXPORTS FALSE CACHE STRING "build in place" FORCE)
I have to use FORCE to force override that. It didn’t work yesterday it that the variable is cached.

add_subdirectory(${_openmp_dir})
it sets that var to cache. later I realize I can disable the export by set that var to false, then I do
set(LIBOMP_COPY_EXPORTS FALSE CACHE STRING "build in place")
add_subdirectory(${_openmp_dir})

git clean -fdx


## header linking

if it’s in header, then it means it will be exported in the end?
Hoyt Koepke 7:30 PM
If it's in the header, and some other library uses them, then you'll get an undefined symbol error on load time if you don't link those symbols in somehow.
which means basically that for it to work, they would have to be exported.

Yes, true, but the unused symbols get pruned.
But that's only for an executable.  Not a library

 HEADER FILES ARE NOT COMPILED
it is that simple
the source files that include the header files are compiled.
